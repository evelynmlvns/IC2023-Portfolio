                I am currently a rising Senior at Speedway
                High School. <br><br>
                I was born
                in California but was raised in Indiana 
                alongside my two younger sisters by my mom
                and abuelita. <br><br>
                I owe everything to my mom and abuelita because
                they have given up so much in order to
                provide for me and my sisters by themselves.<br><br>
                Growing up as the first-born daughter of a single 
                mother has taught me the harsh reality of life at 
                such a young age. But I aspire to one day be an
                example to young hispanic females.

                    <p>Academically I have challenged myself by taking hard level 
                    <br>classes and am currently second in my class. I am by far not
                    the smartest student in class but through the struggles I have
                    <br>seen my interest in the career I want to pursue grow. This is how
                    <br>my interest for computer science started by taking an AP class not
                    <br>knowing that I'd end up connecting with such an amazing program
                    and community.

                    <p>This year in my growth as a sports journalist ,for my highschools
                    <br>newspaper, has given me an in depth knowledge for the love I have
                    for motorsports. I have gotten the oppurtunity to write artcicles
                    about the sport and introduce it to many students who don't know
                    about it.
                    I had the opportunity to interview two female ESPN, Nicole Briscoe
                    and Taylor Tannebaum. Having the opportunity to connect with them
                    gave me so insight about the industry and its sacrifices.
                    Also, for the May edition of my schools newspaper I interviewed 4
                    IndyCar drivers for the Indy 500 race and it was such an amazing.
                    experience. The ability to do such thing as a HS student is incredible.

                    <p>This year I was accepted into the most life-altering program which is
                    becoming a Catapult at NexTech. This program has taught me so much
                    in just five weeks than school has in a whole year. Like I built my
                    own Portfolio all by myself without any major contributing help only
                    by paying attention and going though a lot of trial and error. This 
                    project has taught me a lot of patience, resilience,and developing
                    my coding skills. The people I have met along the way have been nothing
                    but nice and understanding along the process.
                    At the end of July I will also be in IU Bloomington attending a
                    seperate program for HS students wanting to develop their journalism
                    skills.

                    <p>I have also had job experiences that have given me necessary soft skills
                    that will definitely be a must in college and any career I want to pursue
                    in the future. 
                    I currently work at the Freddys Steakburger and Frozen Custard in Speedway
                    I started there on May 2022 as a team member when they first opened
                    the restuarant at this location and have since made my way up as a 
                    Trainer. My current role is training any new employees that are hired and 
                    teaching them everything there is to know about the job and how to properly
                    do certain tasks. It's a very demanding and fast-paced job but I like that
                    aspect of the job.
                    Communication skills is a key factor in maintaining the job and so is 
                    hardwork. I have gotten to meet many new friends and coworkers that has 
                    the job a better atmosphere to be in.

                    One of my favorite hobbies to do is being a part of my High Schools Band
                    we get to do a lot of cool events
                    <br> and march at the Indy 500 festival every year. The different things we get to do makes it worth the long hours
                    <br>of practice and hardwork worth it.
                    <li class="pad2Text">Motorsports Fan</li>
                    As you may already know I am a huge motorsport fan more specifically F1 and IndyCar
                    <br>to me this sport has brought me to love even more the community I live in as Speedway is located
                    <br> just at the center of the heart of the Greatest Spectacle in racing, the IMS.
                    <li class="pad2Text">Soccer</li>
                    Now if you don't see me watching a race than i might be seeing a football match
                    <br>instead because I enjoying playing and watching the sport as well.
                    <br>I played soccer up until my Junior year of HS until I quit when I needed to work more hours at my job.
                    <li class="pad2Text">Shows</li>
                    I am also a huge show lover and like to see all sorts of shows that grasp my attention
                    <br>if not i also like watching YouTube and seeing what my favorite podcasters are doing.
                    <li class="pad2Text">Book enthusiast</li>
                    If you don't know me books are my kryptonite I like to buy books and review them so others can 
                    <br>also read it. I am trying to grow my book collectiona and hopefully one day have as many books as I can to fill up my room.

                    <p>Pursuing a Motorsports Engineering Degree is intriguing to me because
                    <br>learning and working on such unique cars
                    for different series is a one of a kind job
                    <br>that speaks to me. Seeing engineers be a
                    part of teams in this field is so thrilling and
                    <br>no day is the same. There is a very small percentage that make up women
                    in this work field and being a part of that calls to me.
