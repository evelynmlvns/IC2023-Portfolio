            <p class="abtMeText"> My name is Evelyn Luevanos and
                I am currently a rising Senior at Speedway
                High School. <br><br>
                I was born
                in California but was raised in Indiana 
                alongside my two younger sisters by my mom
                and abuelita. <br><br>
                I owe everything to my mom and abuelita because
                they have given up so much in order to
                provide for me and my sisters by themselves.<br><br>
                Growing up as the first-born daughter of a single 
                mother has taught me the harsh reality of life at 
                such a young age. But I aspire to one day be an
                example to young hispanic females.

                    <h2 class="academicsTitle">Academics</h2>
                    <p>Academically I have challenged myself by taking hard level 
                    <br>classes and am currently second in my class. I am by far not
                    <br>the smartest student in class but through the struggles I have
                    <br>seen my interest in the career I want to pursue grow. This is how
                    <br>my interest for computer science started by taking an AP class not
                    <br>knowing that I'd end up connecting with such an amazing program
                    <br>and community.

                    <h2 class="journalismTitle">Journalism</h2>
                    <p>This year in my growth as a sports journalist ,for my highschools
                    <br>newspaper, has given me an in depth knowledge for the love I have
                    <br>for motorsports. I have gotten the oppurtunity to write artcicles
                    <br>about the sport and introduce it to many students who don't know
                    <br>about it.
                    <br>I had the opportunity to interview two female ESPN, Nicole Briscoe
                    <br>and Taylor Tannebaum. Having the opportunity to connect with them
                    <br>gave me so insight about the industry and its sacrifices.
                    <br>Also, for the May edition of my schools newspaper I interviewed 4
                    <br>IndyCar drivers for the Indy 500 race and it was such an amazing.
                    <br>experience. The ability to do such thing as a HS student is incredible.

                    <h2 class="programsTitle">Programs</h2>
                    <p>This year I was accepted into the most life-altering program which is
                    <br>becoming a Catapult at NexTech. This program has taught me so much
                    <br>in just five weeks than school has in a whole year. Like I built my
                    <br>own Portfolio all by myself without any major contributing help only
                    <br>by paying attention and going though a lot of trial and error. This 
                    <br>project has taught me a lot of patience, resilience,and developing
                    <br>my coding skills. The people I have met along the way have been nothing
                    <br>but nice and understanding along the process.
                    <br> At the end of July I will also be in IU Bloomington attending a
                    <br>seperate program for HS students wanting to develop their journalism
                    <br>skills.

                    <h2 class="workTitle">Jobs</h2>
                    <p>I have also had job experiences that have given me necessary soft skills
                    <br>that will definitely be a must in college and any career I want to pursue
                    <br>in the future. 
                    <br>I currently work at the Freddys Steakburger and Frozen Custard in Speedway
                    <br>I started there on May 2022 as a team member when they first opened
                    <br>the restuarant at this location and have since made my way up as a 
                    <br>Trainer. My current role is training any new employees that are hired and 
                    <br>teaching them everything there is to know about the job and how to properly
                    <br>do certain tasks. It's a very demanding and fast-paced job but I like that
                    <br>aspect of the job.
                    <br>Communication skills is a key factor in maintaining the job and so is 
                    <br>hardwork. I have gotten to meet many new friends and coworkers that has 
                    <br>the job a better atmosphere to be in.

                    One of my favorite hobbies to do is being a part of my High Schools Band
                    we get to do a lot of cool events
                    <br> and march at the Indy 500 festival every year. The different things we get to do makes it worth the long hours
                    <br>of practice and hardwork worth it.
                    <li class="pad2Text">Motorsports Fan</li>
                    As you may already know I am a huge motorsport fan more specifically F1 and IndyCar
                    <br>to me this sport has brought me to love even more the community I live in as Speedway is located
                    <br> just at the center of the heart of the Greatest Spectacle in racing, the IMS.
                    <li class="pad2Text">Soccer</li>
                    Now if you don't see me watching a race than i might be seeing a football match
                    <br>instead because I enjoying playing and watching the sport as well.
                    <br>I played soccer up until my Junior year of HS until I quit when I needed to work more hours at my job.
                    <li class="pad2Text">Shows</li>
                    I am also a huge show lover and like to see all sorts of shows that grasp my attention
                    <br>if not i also like watching YouTube and seeing what my favorite podcasters are doing.
                    <li class="pad2Text">Book enthusiast</li>
                    If you don't know me books are my kryptonite I like to buy books and review them so others can 
                    <br>also read it. I am trying to grow my book collectiona and hopefully one day have as many books as I can to fill up my room.
